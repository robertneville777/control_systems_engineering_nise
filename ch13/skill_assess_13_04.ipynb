    "#### PROBLEM\n",
    "\n",
    "Find $T(z) = \\frac{C(z)}{R(z)}$ for the system shown in Figure 13.11.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "A full solution will not be given here since Example 13.5 is almost the same. The only difference is instead of $G(s)$ we have $G_{1}(s)$ and $G_{2}(s)$. Let $G(s) = G_{1}(s)G_{2}(s)$ since they are in cascade and can be multiplied together. Thus, instead of the $G(s)$ block in Figure 13.10a, we have a $G_{1}(s)G_{2}(s)$ block. Now the same solution in Example 13.5 can be followed.  We just need to remember that the z-transform of $G_{1}(s)G_{2}(s)$ is $G_{1}G_{2}(z)$, not $G_{1}(z)G_{2}(z)$. In other words, the z-transform of the product of two systems (of $s$) is not equal to the product of the z-transforms of the individual systems (of $s$).\n",

    "In the answer for Example 13.5, the answer for our problem is the same if $G$ is replaced $G_{1}G_{2}$."
