    "First, convert the sine function to its ideal sampled function given by Eq 13.7. Replace $t$ with $kT$ in the function $f(t)$, and substitute this $f(t)$ into Eq 13.1. The series starts at 0 instead of $-\\infty$ due to the step function.\n",

The Laplace transform of $\\delta(t-c)$ is $e^{cs}$. Applying this transform to $f^{*}(t)$ leads to\n",

    "The goal is to convert this series into a closed form. This series is currently in the form of a general [power series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_series). For the power series, there are various cases in which it converges to a closed form, such as geometric, exponential, and sine series. Of these cases, the [geometric series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_series#Geometric_series,_exponential_function_and_sine) is the best candidate since the others use factorials. The geometric series converges to a closed form when |x| < 1:\n",
