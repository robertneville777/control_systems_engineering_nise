    "#### PROBLEM\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine the range of sampling interval $T$ that will make the system shown in Figure 13.16 stable.\n",

    "#### ANSWER\n",
    "NOTE: The first part of this problem is similar to skill-assessment 13.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the z-transform of the forward path function must be found and placed into a closed-loop. Afterwards, the range of $T$ can be found such that the poles are inside the unit circle of the z-plane.\n",

    "The forward function in Figure 13.6, which will be called $G(s)$, is\n",

As $T$ increases, the pole monotonically decreases from +1 to -4, i.e. the pole is moving on the real axis from +1 to -4 in the negative direction in a monotonic manner (never reversing direction). As the pole moves from +1, the pole is stable (inside the unit circle) until it passes -1, after which it leaves the unit circle and is no longer stable. Let us find the value of $T$ at which the pole crosses -1.\n",
