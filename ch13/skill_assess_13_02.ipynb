    "\n",
    "Since the denominator of $F(z)$ is already factored, partial fraction expansion can be used to separate it into terms of $\\frac{1}{1-az^{-1}}$ for which there is a common inverse z-transform pair. However, to use the partial fraction expansion method, the order of the numerator must be less than the denominator. Divide $F(z)$ by z to do this.\n",
